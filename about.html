                <p>
                  I began my journey as a software developer from a chef. I
                  spent most my working life in the kitchen, building teams,
                  creating menus, living a very fast paced enviornmnet.
                  Unfortunately, I was in a motorcycle accident and was left
                  with this uncertainty about my carreer, greatfully it led me
                  to discover my
                  <span class="text-primary">passion</span> for the software
                  industry. I was yearning for something to expand my
                  <span class="text-primary">creativity</span>, I knew I could
                  find something out there where I could create and enjoy like I
                  once did. I began to discover online resources and
                  advertisements offering accelerated programs to build a new
                  carrer. I was definitely intrigued by these, I decided to dig
                  in deeper. I was taking every course I could get my hands on,
                  including resources such as; freecodecamp.org, codecademy.com,
                  sololearn.com, udemy.com, and many tutorials along the way.
                  Pursureing these, I was able to get familiar with<span
                    class="text-primary"
                  >
                    HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, PHP, C++, C#,
                    Ruby, SQL, TypeScript, CoffeeScript, Git, GitHub-Pages,
                    bash, zsh</span
                  >. Now it was time to learn more.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0">
                  A few months later I decided that software developing is what
                  I want to do with the rest of my life. I started to reach out
                  to individuals in my community and started getting a
                  conversation going. I found that a lot of people in the
                  industry were fond of these bootcamps where you can enhance
                  yours skills with a 500-hour intense training camp, so I
                  decided to pursure that next. I started doing some research
                  and started visiting thsese schools to get a better feel of
                  how it would be like to be in this industry. Once I found my
                  match I knew I was going to build something great. Throughout
                  the program I was assigned 3 - 5 assignments a day that ranged
                  from a recap exercise from the content of the day prior, to
                  the brand new content we learned that day. I started to
                  develop my skills very fast now, I was getting better each
                  day. I began to expand my skills in;
                  <span class="text-primary">Python, Django, React, SQL, </span>
                  and <span class="text-primary">JEST.</span> As days came
                  closer to our final project day I was excited to showcase what
                  we learned. I was able to get a full-stack project up with the
                  short 9 days we had to complete it. I used a
                  <span class="text-primary">React, Django, PostgreSQL</span>
                  stack. The web-applications' intention was to bring
                  communities together by the service or lending items or
                  services to each other. I developed a borrowing system where
                  users can search for an item and are shown a list of profiles
                  with that item available. Then the user can choose to message
                  the user through a custom messaging system, and request to
                  borrow the item. Furthermore, I integrated google maps api to
                  show the users position on a map and the users around who are
                  signed up will display on the map accordingly. There were many
                  challenges I faced when building this, one of which being the
                  map system I initially had went down the night before
                  presentation so rebuilding the map with a very short
                  unexpected deadline was a great experience I now know to
                  prepare and learn from. Another great learning experience was,
                  the realization of the importance of planning. While starting
                  the web-app, I was not familiar with react as it was the last
                  thing we learned in the program. I took on the challenge of
                  learning and planning at the same time. I was very confused
                  and I must admit began to get frustrated with a whole new
                  approach using react state management. I took the effort to
                  understand the documentation, to learn how the framework works
                  and to practice with endless failures. But with all failures,
                  comes progress, lessons, and motivation.
                  <span class="text-primary"> I did not give up </span>when I
                  had tried to add authentication to the project and I spent 3
                  days looking for a space that was being recognized as an
                  indent in python. The solution ended up being to copy and
                  paste two identical code snippets. And all I could do was
                  laugh.

                  The frustrations of small simple mistakes can be devasting and
                  make you want to quit, but I push forward as hard as I can,
                  and
